Add's listenloop javascript tags to footer of all pages.

== Description ==

[ListenLoop](http://get.listenloop.com) is B2B retargeting and micro survey solution company. WordPress is being widely used as a web app nowadays, so ListenLoop is an ideal companion app to retarget your prospects and leads, contact them, get their attention, and survey them over time so you convert those leads into paying customers.

This plugin generates the Javascript install code to integrate all of this functionality into your WordPress-powered web app.

To use listenloop on your website its javascript must be added to all pages. This plugin automatically adds that javascript tag to the footer of all pages.

There also is a setting page where you must provide the listenloop key. The plugin will use that key to correctly include the javascript tag on all pages.
